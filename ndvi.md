## See the health of plants from space <!-- { style="margin-top: 7rem" } -->

Have you ever wondered how we can see the health of plants from space? It's not magic, it's science! Plants, like all living things, interact with light in unique ways. By observing these interactions, especially with satellites orbiting our planet, we can unlock a wealth of information about vegetation health, growth, and even drought stress.

This is where the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, or NDVI, comes into play. It's a simple yet powerful tool used by scientists, farmers, and environmentalists worldwide to monitor plant vigor.

#### The world in colors
To understand NDVI, we first need to talk about light. We see the world in colors like red, green, and blue â€“ this is called the visible spectrum. But there's more to light than meets the eye. Plants, for instance, have a very distinct relationship with red light and near-infrared (NIR) light.

Think of a healthy plant: it absorbs most of the red light from the sun for photosynthesis, using that energy to grow. But it strongly reflects near-infrared light. It's almost like a plant's way of saying, "I'm busy photosynthesizing, here's some NIR light back!"

Conversely, unhealthy or sparse vegetation will absorb less red light and reflect less NIR light. It's this contrast between absorbed red and reflected NIR that forms the basis of NDVI.

#### The Normalized difference vegetation index

For our NDVI calculation, we'll focus on two key bands from Sentinel-2:
**Band 4 (B04): Red light** and **Band 8 (B08): Near-Infrared (NIR) light**

Calculating NDVI is surprisingly straightforward. It's a simple ratio that helps us quantify the difference between NIR and Red reflectance. The formula looks like this:

**NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)**

Or, using our Sentinel-2 bands:

**NDVI = (B08 - B04) / (B08 + B04)**

## Here's how we built this <!-- { style="margin-top: 7rem" } -->

Want to build your own Earth observation application? You can use the same powerful tools that power this demo! Here's everything you need to get started:

### ðŸ”§ Core API Component
This visualization is powered by **[titiler-eopf](https://github.com/EOPF-Explorer/titiler-eopf)**, an open-source tile server that makes Zarr-based Earth observation data accessible through simple HTTP endpoints. The live API serving this demo is available at:

**`https://api.explorer.eopf.copernicus.eu/raster/`**

### ðŸ“Š Data Catalog
Browse and discover available datasets through our comprehensive catalog:

**`https://api.explorer.eopf.copernicus.eu/browser/`**

### ðŸš€ Dynamic Processing
What you're seeing above is **[dynamically rendered NDVI](https://api.explorer.eopf.copernicus.eu/raster/collections/sentinel-2-l2a/items/S2C_MSIL2A_20250913T095041_N0511_R079_T33TVF_20250913T151113/WebMercatorQuad/map.html?expression=(/measurements/reflectance/r10m:b08-/measurements/reflectance/r10m:b04)/(/measurements/reflectance/r10m:b08%2b/measurements/reflectance/r10m:b04)&rescale=-1,1&colormap_name=rdylgn)** - no preprocessing needed! The system calculates NDVI on-the-fly using mathematical expressions directly in the URL parameters. For example, the NDVI calculation `(B08-B04)/(B08+B04)` is processed in real-time for any date and location in our archive.

This approach enables you to build responsive Earth observation applications without managing complex data preprocessing pipelines - just point to the data you need and let the API handle the rest!
